# Colorization-of-black-and-white-images
This Deep Learning Project aims to provide colorizing black & white images with Python. In image colorization, we take a black and white image as input and produce a colored image. We will solve this project with OpenCV deep neural network. Like RGB, Lab is another color space. It is also three channel color space like RGB.

 
### Requirements
- Python 3.7.4
- Tkinter
- PIL
- Numpy
- Open-Cv

### Excecution Steps
#### Step 1 - Download models

colorization_deploy_v2.prototxt [here](https://github.com/richzhang/colorization/blob/master/models/colorization_deploy_v2.prototxt)

colorization_release_v2.caffemodel [here](https://github.com/richzhang/colorization/blob/master/models/fetch_release_models.sh)

pts_in_hull.npy [here](https://github.com/richzhang/colorization/blob/master/resources/pts_in_hull.npy)

#### Step 2 - Create model folder and Add all these models

#### Step 3 - Run ```demo.py```
