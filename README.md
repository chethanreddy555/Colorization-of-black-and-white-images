# Colorization-of-black-and-white-images
This Deep Learning Project aims to provide colorizing black & white images with Python. In image colorization, we take a black and white image as input and produce a colored image. We will solve this project with OpenCV deep neural network. Like RGB, Lab is another color space. It is also three channel color space like RGB.

  ## Requirements
  1. Python
  2. Open-CV
  3. VS Code
  4. Caffe Model(LAB)
